    "First Orchard is simplified version of the children's board game \"Orchard\" and is meant as a first game for ages 2+.\n",
    "The goal of this cooperative game is to collect all 4 fruits from each of 4 fruit trees (red apples, green apples, yellow pears and blue plums) before a crow arrives at the orchard to steal the fruits.\n",
    "Players take turns to roll a 6-sided dice with the faces showing the 4 different fruit colors, the crow and a fruit basket.\n",
    "When rolling a color, a fruit of the corresponding type can be collected if there is still one remaining.\n",
    "When rolling the basket, the player can choose to pick any of the remaining fruits.\n",

    "There are children's games that proceed without any decisions by the players.\n",

    "For optimal play one should always take the fruit type, of which the most fruits remain, so that the chance of rolling a completely harvested fruit is minimized. \n",
    "For the lowest win probability, one can do the opposite by trying to completely strip of one fruit tree before moving to the next. \n",

    "From experience it's rather futile to explain to a 2-year-old why the latter is not a good strategy, so I wanted to at least know how big the impact is on the win probability."
